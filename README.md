### Comparing a set of datasets with the dataset popularity listing

This is an attempt to use the dataset popularity listing to select the most relevant samples among a list of MC samples proposed as legacy.

The popularity listing can be exported from https://cmsweb.cern.ch/popdb/popularity/dataSetTable

The sample listing for a given search criteria (reprocessing etc) can exported from CMSDAS.

This code reads in the popularity listing and writes out an ordered list for the given sample listing.
